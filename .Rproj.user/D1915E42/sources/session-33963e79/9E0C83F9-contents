# The Evolution of Response Rates Across Different Modes of Data Collection and Its Implications for Survey Quality

## Overview

The fundamental aim of sampling in survey research is to derive accurate and timely estimates of key outcomes. However, the changing landscape of response rates across different modes of data collection poses significant challenges to achieving this goal. This document explores the trends in survey response rates, focusing on the transition towards web surveys and the implications for survey quality and nonresponse adjustments.
